Django uses the manage.py module to do many different command line tasks like start a new project or make database migrations (Example: python3 manage.py makemigrations)

My project can/will have several seperate "Apps" in it. Currently there is a blog app.

After making model changes:
    python3 manage.py makemigrations
    python3 manage.py migrate

    To see the sqlcode that it will run in the migration:
        python3 manage.py sqlmigrate <app_name> <migration number>
        (Example: python3 manage.py sqlmigrate blog 0001)

Sample user query:
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

User.objects.all()
User.objects.first()
User.objects.get(id=1)
drew = User.objects.filter(username='drewxcom')
drew.id 
    1

Django has a special _set method for retrning all related data from a model:
user = User.objects.get(id=1)
user.post_set.all() # This will return all posts from said user

You can also create a db entry this way:
user.post_set.create(title="Post title 3", content="Third post content") # No need to add the author (it's using the user) and no need to save!

Sample data input:
user = User.objects.get(id=1)
post_1 = Post(title='Blog_1', content="First post content!", author=user)
post_1.save()

Ideas:
Change the post filtering to show tags instead of authors and have have links to identicial tags
